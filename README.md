# Handy IT Repository
This is a side project that serves as a personal collection of handy tips, insightful articles, and useful hints — all loosely related to IT and tech topics.

## Purpose
The main goal of this repository is to:

Keep track of interesting or useful IT-related content

Serve as a quick reference for common problems or solutions

Act as a living notebook for tech experiments, tricks, or notes

## What's inside
Short tips or code snippets

Articles and summaries

## Notes
This application is a work-in-progress.

Not everything is perfectly polished — it’s more of a personal knowledge base than a public wiki.

Contributions, ideas, or feedback are welcome!
